<template name="hello">
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>

You can see a text because ab Session was set to TRUE.
When you press the re-run button, the with helper will rerun, as can be seen in the console.
When you press the FALSE button, the text will disappear (as expected),
but the helper passed to the #with block will also loose is reactivity!

  <input type="button" class="rerun" value="Rerun session, check console" />
  <input type="button" class="false" value="Set session to FALSE" />

Text in with block comes here:<br>
	{{#with myHelper}}
	  	Some text in a #with block.
	{{/with}}
</template>
